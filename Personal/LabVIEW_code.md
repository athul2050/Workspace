## **Steps to Create the SubVI:**

### **Step 1: Create a New VI**
1. Open **LabVIEW**.
2. Create a new **VI** by selecting **File** â†’ **New VI**.
3. Open the **Block Diagram** by selecting **Window** â†’ **Show Block Diagram**.

---

### **Step 2: Add Controls and Indicators**
1. In the **Front Panel**, add the following controls:
   - **Four Numeric Controls** (Floating-Point):
     - Rename them as **In1**, **In2**, **In3**, and **In4**.
   - **One Unsigned 8-bit Integer Control**:
     - Rename it as **Select**.
   - **One Numeric Indicator** (Floating-Point):
     - Rename it as **Out**.

2. Arrange the controls neatly on the **Front Panel**.

---

### **Step 3: Implement the Multiplexer Logic in the Block Diagram**
1. **Navigate to the Block Diagram**.
2. **Add a Case Structure**:
   - From the **Functions Palette**, go to:
     ```
     Programming â†’ Structures â†’ Case Structure
     ```
   - Place the **Case Structure** on the Block Diagram.
   - Connect the **Select** control to the **Case Selector** input.

3. **Create Cases for Each Selection Value**:
   - Add **four cases** (`1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`).
   - Inside each case, wire the corresponding input to the output:
     - **Case 1**: Wire **In1** to **Out**.
     - **Case 2**: Wire **In2** to **Out**.
     - **Case 3**: Wire **In3** to **Out**.
     - **Case 4**: Wire **In4** to **Out**.
   - For any **default case**, you can set the output to `0` or any desired value.

---

### **Step 4: Create the SubVI**
1. Select all the elements in the **Block Diagram**.
2. From the **Edit menu**, choose **Create SubVI**.
3. This will automatically generate a subVI that you can use in other programs.
4. Save the subVI with a meaningful name, such as **Multiplexer_SubVI.vi**.

---

### **Step 5: Testing the SubVI**
1. Open the **Top-Level VI** where you want to use this subVI.
2. Place the **Multiplexer SubVI** inside the **Block Diagram**.
3. Provide test inputs (`In1`, `In2`, `In3`, `In4`) and change the **Select** value to verify the correct output.

---

## **Alternative Approach Using the Select Function**
Instead of a **Case Structure**, you can use the **Select Function**:
1. From the **Functions Palette**, go to:
   ```
   Programming â†’ Comparison â†’ Select
   ```
2. Use a **nested Select** approach:
   - First **Select Function**: Chooses between `In1` and `In2` (if `Select` is `1` or `2`).
   - Second **Select Function**: Chooses between `In3` and `In4` (if `Select` is `3` or `4`).
   - A final **Select Function**: Chooses between the results of the first two.
3. This approach avoids a **Case Structure** but requires three **Select Functions**.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- The **Case Structure** method is more readable.
- The **Select Function** method is compact and efficient.
- The subVI can now be used in multiple VIs, making your program modular.

#### Version 2 ###
### **Understanding Function VI and the Programming Comparison Palette in LabVIEW**

In **LabVIEW**, a **Function VI** refers to built-in functions that perform specific operations, similar to predefined functions in text-based programming languages. These **Function VIs** do not have a front panel like user-created **SubVIs** but work in the background within a program.

---

## **1. What is the "Programming Comparison Palette" in LabVIEW?**
The **Programming Comparison Palette** in **LabVIEW** contains functions used for making comparisons between values. These functions help in logical decision-making by comparing numbers, strings, and Boolean values.

### **Location of the Comparison Palette**
You can find the **Comparison Palette** in LabVIEW by navigating to:
```
Functions Palette â†’ Programming â†’ Comparison
```

---

## **2. Functions Available in the Comparison Palette**
The **Comparison Palette** includes various functions, including:

| **Function Name**    | **Description** |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **Equal (==)** | Checks if two values are equal. |
| **Not Equal (â‰ )** | Checks if two values are different. |
| **Greater Than (>)** | Checks if the first value is greater than the second. |
| **Greater or Equal (â‰¥)** | Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second. |
| **Less Than (<)** | Checks if the first value is less than the second. |
| **Less or Equal (â‰¤)** | Checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second. |
| **Max & Min** | Returns the maximum or minimum of two inputs. |
| **In Range and Coerce** | Checks if a value falls within a specified range. |
| **Select Function** | Selects one of two inputs based on a Boolean or integer condition. |

---

## **3. The "Select" Function in LabVIEW**
The **Select Function VI** is part of the **Comparison Palette** and is useful for implementing conditional logic.

### **How the Select Function Works**
- The **Select Function** has **three inputs**:
  1. **Selector Input (Boolean or Numeric)**: Determines which value to pass to the output.
  2. **True/Upper Input**: The value used if the selector condition is `True` or a certain number.
  3. **False/Lower Input**: The value used if the selector condition is `False` or a different number.

### **Example Usage:**
- If the **Selector Input = 1**, the function outputs the first input.
- If the **Selector Input = 2**, it outputs the second input.

This is useful when creating a **multiplexer**, as in the **SubVI** we discussed earlier.

---

## **4. Using the Select Function for Multiplexing**
Instead of using a **Case Structure**, you can implement a **4-to-1 Multiplexer** using multiple **Select Functions**:

### **Steps to Implement:**
1. From the **Functions Palette**, go to:
   ```
   Programming â†’ Comparison â†’ Select
   ```
2. **Use Nested Select Functions**:
   - First **Select Function**: Chooses between `In1` and `In2` if `Select` is `1` or `2`.
   - Second **Select Function**: Chooses between `In3` and `In4` if `Select` is `3` or `4`.
   - Third **Select Function**: Chooses between the results of the first two **Select Functions** based on the `Select` value.

### **Wiring Logic:**
1. First Select Function:
   - Selector: `Select â‰¤ 2`
   - Inputs: `In1` and `In2`
2. Second Select Function:
   - Selector: `Select â‰¥ 3`
   - Inputs: `In3` and `In4`
3. Final Select Function:
   - Selector: `Select â‰¤ 2`
   - Inputs: Output from the **First** and **Second** Select Functions

This logic ensures:
- `Select = 1` â†’ Output = `In1`
- `Select = 2` â†’ Output = `In2`
- `Select = 3` â†’ Output = `In3`
- `Select = 4` â†’ Output = `In4`

---

## **Conclusion**
- The **Programming Comparison Palette** contains essential logical and numerical comparison functions.
- The **Select Function VI** allows for efficient **multiplexing** without using a Case Structure.
- **Using Select Functions in a nested approach** provides a compact way to implement selection logic.
